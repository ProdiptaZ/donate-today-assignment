                <p>Money is not the only commodity that is fun to give. We can give time, <br> we can give our
                    expertise, we
                    can
                    give
                    our love, orsimply give a smile. What does that cost? <br> The point is, none of us can ever run out
                    of
                    something worthwhile to give.</p>
